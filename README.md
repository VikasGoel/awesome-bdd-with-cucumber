# Awesome BDD with Cucumber


* This project is a clone from Thilina Ashen Gamage's work .. he provides the following nice tutorials on Behavior Driven Development (BDD) and how to use Cucumber for BDD (Java + Maven) .. I highly recommend going through the tutorials in the following order:
    * **Behavior Driven Development (BDD) & Software Testing in Agile Environments:** https://medium.com/agile-vision/behavior-driven-development-bdd-software-testing-in-agile-environments-d5327c0f9e2d

    * **Cucumber BDD (Part 1):** https://medium.com/agile-vision/starting-with-bdd-for-collaborative-development-in-agile-environments-5fb034078b3c

    * **Cucumber BDD (Part 2):** https://medium.com/agile-vision/cucumber-bdd-part-2-creating-a-sample-java-project-with-cucumber-testng-and-maven-127a1053c180

* I normally use this project for demonstration purposes in my Jenkins training courses!
